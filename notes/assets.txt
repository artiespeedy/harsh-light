There should be a .lua file describing how to load a tilesheet accompanying every tilesheet
It should have:
twidth = however many pixels wide the tiles are
theight = however many pixels height the tiles are
sheetW = however many tiles there are in a row
seperatorW = however wide the tile seperators are (use 1 unless there is a reason not to)
tmeta = a map of the names of the tiles that point to their indicies. The index on a tile is an array of the indicies for that tile, allowing for multiple versions of the same tile. If you are adding a non-standard sized tile, put an array of arrays that have the x, y, width, height of the sprite on the image
